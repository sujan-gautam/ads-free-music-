## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Create App Icons (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://www.favicon-generator.org/

3. Download and rename to:
   - `icon-192.png`
   - `icon-512.png`

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)
```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

vercel --prod
```

**When prompted:**
- Directory: `./client`

You'll get a URL like: `https://music-player-xxx.vercel.app`
