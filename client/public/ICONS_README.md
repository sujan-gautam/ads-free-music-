## Quick Specs:

**icon-192.png:**
- Size: 192x192 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Background: Not transparent (use solid color)
- Purpose: Home screen icon on iPhone

**icon-512.png:**
- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Background: Not transparent (use solid color)
- Purpose: Splash screen, high-res displays

## Temporary Placeholder:

If you want to test without icons, you can:
1. Create any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files
2. Use solid purple background
3. Add white text "MP" or "🎵"
4. Save as icon-192.png and icon-512.png

The app will work, just won't look as polished.

## After Creating Icons:

1. Place both files here: `client/public/`
2. Verify files exist:
   - `client/public/icon-192.png`
   - `client/public/icon-512.png`
